**Problem Statement**

**Objective**

To evaluate and oversee the bankâ€™s lending operations and performance, we need to develop a detailed Bank Loan Analysis Report. This report aims to offer insights into crucial loan-related metrics and their variations over time. It will assist us in making informed decisions based on data, monitoring our loan portfolio, and identifying trends that can guide our lending strategies.
