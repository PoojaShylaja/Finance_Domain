 ## Finance Domain - Bank Loan Report

**Problem Statement**

To evaluate and oversee the bankâ€™s lending operations and performance, we need to develop a detailed Bank Loan Analysis Report. This report aims to offer insights into crucial loan-related metrics and their variations over time. It will assist us in making informed decisions based on data, monitoring our loan portfolio, and identifying trends that can guide our lending strategies.

  Then we creted a Detailed Page for data as well.

This dashboard explains the total loan applications, total loan amount, total payment amount, average rate of interest, and 
average DTI percentage.It details the percentage of good loans issued, applications received, amounts given to customers, 
and the total amount received.Similarly, it covers the percentage of bad loans issued, applications received, amounts 
given to customers, and the total amount received.Different types of grade loans are issued, including A, B, C, 
D, E, F, and G.The purpose of taking loans includes categories like credit card, debt consolidation, education, 
home improvement, medical, other, small business, and vacations, among others.

  From the above Dashboard we created main KPI'S for 
  1. Total Loan applications
  2. Total funded Amount
  3. Total Amount Recieved
  4. Avg. Interest Rate
  5. DTI

  We have created  slicers for grade and purpose so that we can go further and find out Loan details. Created donut chart
  for good and bad loans issued.
